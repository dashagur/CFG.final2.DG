            Venice is built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. 
            It has no roads, just canals – including the Grand Canal thoroughfare – lined 
            with Renaissance and Gothic palaces. The central square, Piazza San Marco, contains 
            St. Mark’s Basilica, which is tiled with Byzantine mosaics, and the Campanile bell 
            tower offering views of the city’s red roofs.
            The biggest attraction in the gorgeous city of Venice is the architecture. The Grand 
            Canal is the centre of activity, with gondoliers singing to the passengers in their boats.
            The magnificent Piazza Sam Marco is another must-see hub. Along the winding streets you’ll 
            find stylish cafes and gelaterias, souvenir shops and small businesses, plus Renaissance 
            palaces and Gothic churches. After you've climbed the Campanille and visited the Gallerie 
            dell Accademia, stroll through the surrounding neighbourhoods, where locals eat cicchitti 
            and drink their vino in unfussy bars and restaurants.
